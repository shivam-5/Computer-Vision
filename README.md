# Computer-Vision

1. Image segmentation: Creating a generalized segmentation model that can separate out useful objects in any new image.
  - Using edge detectors like cann, Laplacia-of-gaussian
  - Using morphological operations


2. Feature matching: Finding the matching points of one image in another image that has been transformed using translation, rotation or scaling.
  - Use of feature detectors(surf, Harris, Brisk)
  

3. Object detection: Finding two particular types of lego bricks in any image containing large combinations of lego bricks
  - Image augmentation using translation, scaling and rotation(data not included)
  - Use of ACF object detector
